# ProjectWebScrapper
Web Scrapper | Search Engine for Scrapped Results | Python | BeautifulSoup

This is a passion project where I have scrapped data from the archives of The Hindu news website and created a search engine to look for names inside the scraped data.
What it does: Get all the articles from the archives of The Hindu from the entire year of 2010 and creates a 'database' (text file) within which we can search for articles with matching names of famous people.
BeautifulSoup libraries were used to get the clean data from the site.
